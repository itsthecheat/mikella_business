            <h2>What is art therapy?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Art Therapy is a unique form of psychotherapy that uses the art process to assist clients in expressing thoughts, feelings, and memories.  It can function as an auxiliary process, sometimes called “Art as Therapy,” wherein people find relief and healing from the art process itself, and also engage in verbal discussion aided by the soothing properties of art-making; or it can also function as a primary process, with thoughts and feelings being expressed directly through the art that is made, and may not be remarked upon verbally at that time.</p>

               Most people seek therapy because they are experiencing some sort of pain or discomfort in their lives and want to find relief.  For some there may be experiences from their past that hinder the ability to find fulfillment in work or relationships,  for others recent events have disrupted their lives in ways that feel new or foreign,  and still others are unsure of the cause but are blocked from the satisfaction they desire.  Regardless of the reasons for seeking therapy,  one of my fundamental goals as a clinician is to help patients find relief and meaning in their lives.
               Depending on the individual problems and challenges presented therapy may be short term or longer term, but my approach to treatment goes beyond just "talking things through" and focuses on developing the insight and skills to make meaningful change.

               I work with adolescents, emerging adults, and adults; individuals, couples, and families.

                <h4>Trauma</h4>
                <p>Virtually everyone experiences some sort of trauma during the lifespan, and humans are very resilient in the face of stress.  There are also some types of events that are so threatening, scary, sudden or confusing that it changes one's perspective on themselves, others, and the world.  This is called "trauma response" or "post traumatic stress."</p>

                <h4>Grief</h4>
                <p>
                  Some theorists have said that grief is the universal trauma; death is a part of life.  Support through the loss of a significant person is critically important, especially for children and when coping with shocking, unexpected, or violent death.
                  My approach validates grief as an ongoing process, while emphasizing the importantance of finding the means to move forward while still remembering the person.

            <!-- In trauma-focused therapy, focus is split between decreasing unwanted "symptoms" and developing a cohesive understanding of what happened and how it affected you.  The length and style of treatment depends on the type of trauma (link). -->
            <!-- From "type of trauma" link above-
            "Acute trauma and PTSD
            When something tragic or terrifying occurs, such as being the witness or victim of a crime or having a serious accident, most people experience an increase in stress in the immediate aftermath that gradually decreases over several months, provided that a person has some coping skills to manage feelings.  This is called acute stress, and if treatment is required it is often short term.
            When acute stress persists, it becomes post traumatic stress.
            Complex trauma
            When trauma is experienced repeatedly over time, or occurs primarily in the attachment between parent and child or through emotional means, it can create persistent challenges with developing and maintaining relationships, and managing feelings that arise in relationships.  This is frequently called complex trauma or relational trauma.  Art therapy is a particularly effective method for working with complex trauma, however I also employ other techniques including cognitive behavioral and dialectical behavioral approaches to develop insight." -->

              On a personal and professional level I am committed to providing affirming treatment to the LGBTQIA community, and maintaining a flexible and respectful approach to various expressions of sexuality.  This includes but is not limited to binary and non-binary gender identity and sexual orientation, coming out, transition, asexuality, polyamory and/or non-monagamy, power play, and intersections of sexuality and trauma.

Whether you have difficulty connecting or maintaining connection, struggle with intimacy, experience relationship patterns that seem to keep repeating, or strive for better communication, therapy can be a great tool to understand and resolve these challenges.

          <br>
            <p>Mikella is the developer and supervisor of the Art Therapy Internship Program at Sanctuary for Families, and supervises graduate level interns from New York University.  She is also a co-supervisor at Camp Good Grief, a therapeutic bereavement camp organized by East End Hospice.

            Mikella believes that the foundation for excellence in clinical practice begins with effective, skilled, and nurturing supervision.  For the beginning professional, supervision offers the guidance and support to apply skills and knowledge, and develop one's individual style.  For the more seasoned practitioner, it is the process of continuing one's growth after the formal education process has ended, and ensuring that objective feedback can be integrated into current work.  In addition to working with students, Mikella is available for clinical supervision in private practice for Creative Arts Therapists and other mental Health professionals.
