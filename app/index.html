                   <p>Art Therapy is a unique form of psychotherapy that
                       uses the art process to assist clients in expressing
                       thoughts, feelings, and memories. It can function
                       as an auxiliary process, sometimes called “Art
                       as Therapy,” wherein people find relief and healing
                       from the art process itself, and also engage in
                       verbal discussion aided by the soothing properties
                       of art-making; or it can also function as a primary
                       process, with thoughts and feelings being expressed
                       directly through the art that is made, and may
                       not be remarked upon verbally at that time.</p>

                           id="art-therapy-picture">
                       <p>The creative process uses areas of the brain that are typically associated with sensory memory, experience of emotion and imaginative play, making Art Therapy ideal for some populations that may not be as responsive to verbally oriented therapies such as: children, persons with developmental problems or disabilities, trauma survivors, introverted persons or those who experience high levels of anxiety, traumatic brain injuries, and individuals with substance use problems.</p>
                   <p>
                       It is also helpful for families, or individuals who have difficulty accessing unconscious material and wish to develop greater capacity for insight.

                               Most people seek therapy because they are experiencing some sort of pain
                               or discomfort in their lives and want to
                               find relief. For some there may be experiences
                               from their past that hinder the ability
                               to find fulfillment in work or relationships,
                               for others recent events have disrupted
                               their lives in ways that feel new or foreign,
                               and still others are unsure of the cause
                               but are blocked from the satisfaction they
                               desire. Regardless of the reasons for seeking
                               therapy, one of my fundamental goals as
                               a clinician is to help patients find relief
                               and meaning in their lives. Depending on
                               the individual problems and challenges
                               presented therapy may be short term or
                               longer term, but my approach to treatment
                               goes beyond just "talking things through"
                               and focuses on developing the insight and
                               skills to make meaningful change.

                           <p>Virtually everyone experiences some sort of
                               trauma during the lifespan, and humans
                               are very resilient in the face of stress.
                               There are also some types of events that
                               are so threatening, scary, sudden or confusing
                               that it changes one's perspective on themselves,
                               others, and the world. This is called "trauma
                               response" or "post traumatic stress."
                           </p>
                           <p>
                               In trauma-focused therapy, focus is split between decreasing unwanted "symptoms" and developing a cohesive understanding of what happened and how it affected you.  The length and style of treatment depends on the <span id="trauma-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target=".bs-example-modal-sm">type of trauma</span>.

                                   <h3>Acute trauma and PTSD</h3>
                                       <p>
                                         When something tragic or terrifying occurs, such as being the witness or victim of a crime or having a serious accident, most people experience an increase in stress in the immediate aftermath that gradually decreases over several months, provided that a person has some coping skills to manage feelings.  This is called acute stress, and if treatment is required it is often short term.
                                         When acute stress persists, it becomes post traumatic stress.
                                       </p>
                                         <h3>Complex trauma</h3>
                                       <p>
                                         When trauma is experienced repeatedly over time, or occurs primarily in the attachment between parent and child or through emotional means, it can create persistent challenges with developing and maintaining relationships, and managing feelings that arise in relationships.  This is frequently called complex trauma or relational trauma.  Art therapy is a particularly effective method for working with complex trauma, however I also employ other techniques including cognitive behavioral and dialectical behavioral approaches to develop insight.

                               <p>Some theorists have said that grief is the universal trauma; death is a
                               part of life. Support through the loss
                               of a significant person is critically important,
                               especially for children and when coping
                               with shocking, unexpected, or violent death.
                               My approach validates grief as an ongoing
                               process, while emphasizing the importantance
                               of finding the means to move forward.</p>

                               This topic is one of the most common reasons that individuals and couples
                               seek therapy. Whether you have difficulty
                               connecting or maintaining connection, struggle
                               with intimacy, experience relationship
                               patterns that seem to keep repeating, or
                               strive for better communication, therapy
                               can be a great tool to understand and resolve
                               these challenges.

                    <p> Mikella believes
                       that the foundation for excellence in clinical
                       practice begins with effective, skilled, and nurturing
                       supervision. For the beginning professional, supervision
                       offers the guidance and support to apply skills
                       and knowledge, and develop one's individual style.
                       For the more seasoned practitioner, it is the process
                       of continuing one's growth after the formal education
                       process has ended, and ensuring that objective
                       feedback can be integrated into current work. In
                       addition to working with students, Mikella is available
                       for clinical supervision in private practice for
                       Creative Arts Therapists and other mental Health
                       professionals.
