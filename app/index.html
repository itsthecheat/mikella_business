        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>Art Therapy is a unique form of psychotherapy that
            uses the art process to assist clients in expressing
            thoughts, feelings, and memories. It can function
            as an auxiliary process, sometimes called “Art
            as Therapy,” wherein people find relief and healing
            from the art process itself, and also engage in
            verbal discussion aided by the soothing properties
            of art-making; or it can also function as a primary
            process, with thoughts and feelings being expressed
            directly through the art that is made, and may
            not be remarked upon verbally at that time.</p>
          <img src="images/whatis.jpg" alt="Drawing by Mikella Millen" class="img-responsive" id="art-therapy-picture">
          <p>The creative process uses areas of the brain that are typically associated with sensory memory, experience of emotion and imaginative play, making Art Therapy ideal for some populations that may not be as responsive to verbally oriented
            therapies such as: children, persons with developmental problems or disabilities, trauma survivors, introverted persons or those who experience high levels of anxiety, traumatic brain injuries, and individuals with substance use
            problems.</p>
          <p>
            It is also helpful for families, or individuals who have difficulty accessing unconscious material and wish to develop greater capacity for insight.
          </p>
          <p>Drawing upon her background in sculpture, Mikella also works with patients to use three dimensional art-making to symbolize conflicts or intentions, in order to transform the object or imbue it with meaning. This can be as concrete as
            writing a letter or depicting a memory, and then transforming or destroying the object; or as abstract as creating talismans or ritual objects during session.

            Most people seek therapy because they are experiencing some sort of pain
            or discomfort in their lives and want to
            find relief. For some there may be experiences
            from their past that hinder the ability
            to find fulfillment in work or relationships,
            for others recent events have disrupted
            their lives in ways that feel new or foreign,
            and still others are unsure of the cause
            but are blocked from the satisfaction they
            desire. Regardless of the reasons for seeking
            therapy, one of my fundamental goals as
            a clinician is to help patients find relief
            and meaning in their lives. Depending on
            the individual problems and challenges
            presented therapy may be short term or
            longer term, but my approach to treatment
            goes beyond just "talking things through"
            and focuses on developing the insight and
            skills to make meaningful change.
            <br>
            <br>
            My therapeutic style draws on a wide range of techniques and modalities, in order to provide individualized treatment that meets your current needs. This includes cognitive behavior therapy, somatic and body focused work, mindfulness,
            hypnosis, dreamwork, creative arts expression, hypnosis, and psychodynamic approaches.
            <br>
            <br>
            I work with adolescents, emerging adults,
            and adults; individuals, couples, and families.

        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>Mikella's approach to dreamwork is drawn from the gestalt style, during which a dream is explored using present tense, first person recreation of the dream space. Dreamwork allows for the practitioner and client to coexist in the dream
            space and explore it from different perspectives, often leading the client to new insights and resolution of unconscious conflicts. This style differs from dream analysis in its focus on active exploration, rather than interpretation.
            Dreamwork can be utilized in conjunction with ongoing psychotherapy or as a standalone practice. Standalone Dreamwork sessions can be scheduled

          <p>Virtually everyone experiences some sort of
            trauma during the lifespan, and humans
            are very resilient in the face of stress.
            There are also some types of events that
            are so threatening, scary, sudden or confusing
            that it changes one's perspective on themselves,
            others, and the world. This is called "trauma
            response" or "post traumatic stress."
          </p>
          <p>
            In trauma-focused therapy, focus is split between decreasing unwanted "symptoms" and developing a cohesive understanding of what happened and how it affected you. The length and style of treatment depends on the <span id="trauma-modal"
              data-toggle="modal" data-target=".bs-example-modal-sm">type of trauma</span>.
          </p>

                <h3>Acute trauma and PTSD</h3>
                <p>
                  When something tragic or terrifying occurs, such as being the witness or victim of a crime or having a serious accident, most people experience an increase in stress in the immediate aftermath that gradually decreases over several
                  months, provided that a person has some coping skills to manage feelings. This is called acute stress, and if treatment is required it is often short term.
                  When acute stress persists, it becomes post traumatic stress.
                </p>
                <h3>Complex trauma</h3>
                <p>
                  When trauma is experienced repeatedly over time, or occurs primarily in the attachment between parent and child or through emotional means, it can create persistent challenges with developing and maintaining relationships, and
                  managing feelings that arise in relationships. This is frequently called complex trauma or relational trauma. Art therapy is a particularly effective method for working with complex trauma, however I also employ other techniques
                  including cognitive behavioral and dialectical behavioral approaches to develop insight.

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="grief">
          <p>Some theorists have said that grief is the universal trauma; death is a
            part of life. Support through the loss
            of a significant person is critically important,
            especially for children and when coping
            with shocking, unexpected, or violent death.
            My approach validates grief as an ongoing
            process, while emphasizing the importantance
            of finding the means to move forward.</p>

            On a personal and professional level I am committed to providing affirming
            treatment to the LGBTQIA community, and
            maintaining a flexible and respectful approach
            to various expressions of sexuality. This
            includes but is not limited to binary and
            non-binary gender identity and sexual orientation,
            coming out, transition, asexuality, polyamory
            and/or non-monagamy, power play, and intersections
            of sexuality and trauma. I work with both

            This topic is one of the most common reasons that individuals and couples
            seek therapy. Whether you have difficulty
            connecting or maintaining connection, struggle
            with intimacy, experience relationship
            patterns that seem to keep repeating, or
            strive for better communication, therapy
            can be a great tool to understand and resolve
            these challenges.

            that the foundation for excellence in clinical
            practice begins with effective, skilled, and nurturing
            supervision. For the beginning professional, supervision
            offers the guidance and support to apply skills
            and knowledge, and develop one's individual style.
            For the more seasoned practitioner, it is the process
            of continuing one's growth after the formal education
            process has ended, and ensuring that objective
            feedback can be integrated into current work. In
            addition to working with students, Mikella is available
            for clinical supervision in private practice for
            Creative Arts Therapists and other mental Health
            professionals.
