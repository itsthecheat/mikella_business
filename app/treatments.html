Ericsonian hypnosis is a form of trance work, wherein the hypnotist provides structure and supervision to help clients learn the skill of exploring their unconscious/subconscious mind, and using that process to tap into inner resources, groundedness, creative flow, self-knowledge and increased focus. Hypnotherapy can be used for a variety of purposes, including changing habits, resolving unconscious blocks and rigidity, and relaxation, and does not require any previous experience. It can be used alone or combined with other modalities, and is a supportive tool to enhance meditation practice. The style I practice is collaborative and the client is in control of the process at all times.
                   </p>
                   <p>
 My particular focus as a hypnotherapist is helping clients develop greater self-worth, cultivating tools for management of anxiety and fear, and helping to integrate conflicting or conflicted parts of the self (including inner child work). I weave somatic practices, visualization, and cultivation of personal symbols in each session; hypnotherapy can be structured and goal directed or free flowing without a specific plan. Email me if you have questions about how hypnotherapy can work for you.

   <p> "I have been dealing with an intense fear of flying for several years.  I tried many different forms of therapy around this including hypnotherapy with a practitioner who made me very uncomfortable.  Nothing worked at all.
</p><p>
I worked with Mikella Millen last year specifically around my fear of flying.  Mikella made me feel so comfortable right from the beginning.  There is a real calm confidence about her that instantly put me at ease.  We talked at length before beginning hypnosis so I knew what to expect.  We did 5 sessions of hypnotherapy leading up to a trip I was taking.  I was not sure if it had even worked until I got on the plane.  I was so much calmer than I had been previously.  I’ve found that even though a lot of time has passed, the results have continued to develop for me.  I’m preparing to fly again with almost none of the usual anxiety I’ve felt in the past.  Working with Mikella was a really wonderful experience and would recommend her to anyone looking to overcome a fear or just wanting to get to know themselves a bit better.”

Reiki is translated as Universal Lifeforce Energy, and is a gentle and supportive form of energy work. It can be used in conjunction with any of the aforementioned services. During a reiki session the client is lying down while the reiki is transmitted using a variety of hand placements, or can be done without direct touch. It is a great support for physical ailments, as well as emotional and somatic challenges. It can be especially useful as an adjunctive service to support medical treatment or somatic psychotherapy. </p>

<p>Most people describe receiving reiki as a physically enjoyable experience, which may include sensations of radiating warmth, vibration or pulsing, or the sense of “movement” within the body. Some people do not feel much physically at the time of treatment, but experience shifts later. In both cases most people feel relaxed and at ease during the session, sometimes even falling asleep! I use essential oils, sounds, and crystals to support the process, and there is some time before and after for discussion of your needs and experience.
</p>
<p>
I am especially committed to providing a safe, affirming space for LGBTQIA+ individuals, who are looking for bodywork that is respectful and inclusive of all identities.

  "Mikella was really great to work with, especially it being my first experience with reiki. She was patient and warm, explained everything that she would be doing first, then reviewed with me afterwards what she picked up, and shared her ideas about it very openly, answering all my questions. Great experience!"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  "My Reiki session with Mikella Millen was truly transformative. Mikella organically creates an inclusive and safe space that compliments her warm and gentle approach to the Reiki experience. I literally drifted away as my energy fields released the angst and toxins of NYC’s ever-pulsing environment. Mikella is a true healer - the impact of her healing presence is palpable. I highly recommend Reiki sessions to all including fellow therapists and healers!"

Breathwork is a practice that uses a two-part inhalation to rapidly and deeply oxygenate the body, activating the nervous system and allowing for somatic release of stored trauma. It can sometimes produce strong emotional reactions concurrent with physical sensations, and works quickly to provide relief and healing from trauma and pain. Frequently one may also experience altered states of consciousness that can provide clarity and insight into both blocks and paths forward. It can also be a tool for enhancing creative process and cultivating intuition. Mikella was inspired to include this in her practice through her personal use of breathwork, and the observation of its many benefits. Her extensive experience as a trauma-focused mental health provider allows for sensitive and skilled facilitation of breathwork for individuals with complex trauma histories. Breathwork is offered as a standalone treatment, and can also be incorporated into psychotherapy if desired.

                     <h3>
                      How do I know if these modalities are right for me, as opposed to Psychotherapy?
                     </h3>
<p>
                     Supportive modalities have the potential to be hugely therapeutic, however they are not a substitute for therapy. But there are a number of reasons why the structure and qualities of these methods may be preferable. The first is they do not require the standard “once per week on the same day and time” format. Supportive work can be weekly for a short period of time, periodically, or as needed. Some people find that even one session can be hugely beneficial, although at least few sessions are suggested. This may be a better fit for those with irregular schedules, who travel frequently, or who are not financially able to commit to a weekly ongoing appointment. <p>
                       The second is that this type of work can be very helpful for those who have already been in psychotherapy, and are ambivalent about “starting over” or how they will make progress without hashing over the same material and memories. Sometimes the result of this work is that an individual does decide they wish to return to therapy, in which case I can make a referral using my wide network of talented therapists. All of these modalities are primarily non-verbal or subconsciously oriented, so there is no need for a long intake process; we can dive right in to the core issues without needing to disclose details.</p>

                     <h3>If you’re a Psychotherapist, why would I see you for reiki or breathwork?</h3>

                     <p>Sometimes in body-based work, powerful emotions can arise particularly as they relate to attachment wounds and trauma. Over 10 years of experience working directly with complex trauma and grief make me uniquely prepared to respond and assist in a sensitive way should such material surface during a session. My background in psychotherapy and clinical neuroscience also allows me offer information about how the body may respond to certain experiences and treatments, which some people find helpful and grounding.</p>

                     <h3>How long does it take to see results? How frequently do I need to attend?</h3>

                    <p> These practices do not necessarily need to abide by the once per week structure common of psychotherapy.  Like most challenges, the length of treatment depends on the complexity of the problem.  Both Reiki and Hypnosis can be used periodically as a supportive and relaxing service, much like a massage or meditation group.  For deeper conflicts or chronic issues it is useful to plan on 3-5 sessions to see tangible results beyond the experience of the session itself.<p>

                     <h3>How do I schedule an appointment and how much does it cost?</h3>

                    <p> Use my scheduler below, or email me for availability.  Most sessions are about an hour and cost $175. You can purchase a package of sessions as well which offers a discount to the overall rate.</p>

As an expansion to her training in working with unconscious and trance states, Mikella has completed her Training in Ericsonian Hypnosis with the NLP Center of New York. She is also a Non-Traditional Reiki Master Teacher (Level 3) and was certified by <a href="http://www.radicalreiki.com">Shannon O'Neil-Loyola</a>.</p>
<p>
Mikella trained with Erin Telford and David Elliot to facilitate 2-stage Pranayama breathwork meditation as a somatic approach to supporting trauma processing, and uses that along with other therapeutic techniques to work with trauma held in the body.
Combined with her training as a psychotherapist and meditation practitioner she uses a unique approach weaving multiple modalities together to help individuals connect with their unconscious mind, work through blocks, and achieve a greater sense of embodiment and relaxation.
